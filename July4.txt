STRING Declaration of Independence: A Transcription
ENTER
STRING In Congress, July 4, 1776
ENTER
STRING The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, 
ENTER
STRING it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another,
ENTER
STRING and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them,
ENTER
STRING a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
ENTER
STRING We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,
ENTER
STRING that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, 
ENTER
STRING deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, 
ENTER
STRING it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles 
ENTER
STRING and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. 
ENTER
STRING Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; 
ENTER
STRING and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, 
ENTER
STRING than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, 
ENTER
STRING pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, 
ENTER
STRING and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; 
ENTER
STRING and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history 
ENTER
STRING of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
ENTER
STRING He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
ENTER
STRING He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; 
ENTER 
STRING and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
ENTER
STRING He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish 
ENTER
STRING the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
ENTER
STRING He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, 
ENTER
STRING for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
ENTER
STRING He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
ENTER
STRING He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, 
ENTER
STRING have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
ENTER
STRING He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; 
ENTER
STRING refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
ENTER
STRING He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.
ENTER
STRING He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
ENTER
STRING He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.
ENTER
STRING He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.
ENTER
STRING He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.
ENTER
STRING He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; 
ENTER 
STRING giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:
ENTER
STRING For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
ENTER
STRING For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
ENTER
STRING For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
ENTER
STRING For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:
ENTER
STRING For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:
ENTER
STRING For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences
ENTER
STRING For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, 
ENTER
STRING and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:
ENTER
STRING For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
ENTER
STRING For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
ENTER
STRING He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
ENTER
STRING He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
ENTER
STRING He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, 
ENTER
STRING already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
ENTER
STRING He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, 
ENTER
STRING to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
ENTER
STRING He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, 
ENTER
STRING the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.
ENTER
STRING In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. 
ENTER 
STRING A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
ENTER
STRING Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an 
ENTER
STRING unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their 
ENTER
STRING native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt 
ENTER
STRING our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. 
ENTER
STRING We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.
ENTER
STRING We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the 
ENTER
STRING Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, 
ENTER
STRING solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; 
ENTER 
STRING that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, 
ENTER 
STRING is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, 
ENTER
STRING establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, 
ENTER
STRING with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.
